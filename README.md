# Whisper for Sociolinguistics

This is a repository for a code that uses OpenAI’s [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to automatically transcribe interviews obtained for the sociolinguistics project EMILS-ISMX (Experiencias Migratorias: Identidad, Lengua y Sociedad. Integración Sociolingüística en México) developed by Ph.D. candidate [Brenda Berenice Larios Loza](https://upol.academia.edu/BrendaBereniceLariosLoza) (Palacký University Olomouc and University of Granada, [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brenda-Larios-Loza)).

### About the project EMILS-ISMX

The aim of the project EMILS-ISMX is to study the sociolinguistic integration of Central American and Caribbean migrants in Mexico. In the recent years, a significant number of irregular migrants have been transiting from the South to the North of the American continent. The main reason is the desire to improve their quality of life. In other words, the migrants wish to escape poverty, violence, organized crime as well as other difficult aspects of their lives. Mexico is an important location in their journey since it is the interregional border between the two Americas and each year it receives thousands of migrants (for statistics see Unidad de Política Migratoria).[^1] In this scenery, linguistic factors play a crucial role. Even though the migrants usually have Spanish as their mother tongue, there is a difference between their variety of Spanish and the variety spoken in Mexico. Consequently, they may face linguistic and communicative challenges during their journey.
